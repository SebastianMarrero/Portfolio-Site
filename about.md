![My photo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/profile.jpg){: class="about-pic" }

I'm a data-driven professional with experience in financial technology, SaaS, and data analysis. I use SQL, Python, Tableau, and Jupyter to turn messy data into clear insights. Whether it's building dashboards, modeling churn, or analyzing unicorn companies, I'm always pushing to make data actionable and stories compelling.

In addition to driving data-backed insights, I'm curious about building business strategy and how the global market interacts with each other, whether via the expansive global supply chain, in the equity markets, or the political sphere. I'm equally interested in the psychology side of business, with the idea of black swans - extremely improbable events with enormous impact and consequences proposed by former options trader author Nassim Nicholas Taleb - being the focal point of my studies as I read his book "The Black Swan" for leisure. 

I'm eager to learn anything that catches my attention and imagination, and have centered my professional ambitions around employing the knowledge and skillset I've cultivated to help businesses sharing my vision and values achieve their goals and objectives.

## Featured Projects

### [Credit Card Fraud Data](https://github.com/SebastianMarrero/Credit-Card-Fraud-Analysis)
Python-driven modeling of credit card application fraud. Analysis of behavioral, transactional, and device-level signals contributing to fraudulent credit card applications, using a synthetic dataset inspired by real-world financial institutions. Techniques include precision-optimized classification using Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM, with class imbalance handled through weighted modeling and evaluation based on precision-recall curves. Key predictive features include velocity metrics, credit risk scores, and device-level indicators, all geared toward improving rare-event fraud detection in highly imbalanced data environments.

### [SaaS Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/SebastianMarrero/SAAS-Churn-Analysis-Project)
Python-driven analysis of SaaS customer churn. Exploration of the factors that influence a customer to forego a subscription-based product, where customer service interactions, total dollars spent, and delay of payment are modeled using logistic regression and random forest classification to predict churn incidence.

### [Unicorn Companies SQL Project](https://github.com/SebastianMarrero/Unicorn_SQL_Project)
SQL-driven analysis of global unicorn companies. Explores funding rounds, ROI ratios, and geographic trends using MySQL and Tableau visualizations.

### [NYC Airbnb Market Analysis](https://github.com/SebastianMarrero/NYC_AirBNB_Analysis)
Analyzed short-term rental trends using SQL, Python, and Tableau. Includes sentiment analysis from guest reviews and pricing premium analysis for Superhosts.

## Personal Writing and Interests

In addition to data and analytics, I have a strong interest in political philosophy and critical theory. During my time at Vanderbilt, I authored a research paper for my 2021 Critical Theory Philosophy course, where I explored the historical relationship between capitalism and racism through the lens of Nancy Fraser’s work:

[Read the paper: *Capitalism’s Contingent Entanglement with Racism*](https://github.com/SebastianMarrero/SebastianMarrero/blob/main/Writing%20Sample.pdf)

Outside of work, I enjoy spending quality time with friends, basketball, listening to music and music production, or reading about global markets and business psychology.
